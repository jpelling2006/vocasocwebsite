        "description" : "Instead of tightening our grip by loading up on breakpoints, we can let go, embracing the ebb and flow with a more fluid and systematic approach to our design foundations. Design and develop rapidly using a handful of related rules, building the system, not every permutation of its contents at arbitrary breakpoints. Streamline communication and collaboration between design and development. Visualise the invisible: componentize responsive space, codifying its implementation and behavior. Create bespoke constraints for your projects to ensure consistent and harmonious designs. Swap jarring breakpoint jumps for buttery-smooth interpolation, with programmatically tailored type and space scales for every screen size."
